#+DESCRIPTION: Post hiatus.

* Introduction

Oops, I accidentally had another hiatus.

So last time I said I'd talk about stuff like Node and Ajax. Also recently I've been thinking about keyboard layouts so that could be either a current or future topic.

Also I realized that now I am no longer an IB student, but I can still write about Emacs from a student's perspective! Thought that does mean I'm going to have to get back on track with writing about Emacs and not about other cool stuff.
