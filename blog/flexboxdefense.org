#+DESCRIPTION: Flexbox defense and Flexbox Froggy are pretty cool games for learning flexbox

* Flexbox Defense

  So I was scrolling down Twitter when I noticed this game: Flexbox Defense! It's a tower defense game where you use flexbox CSS rules to position the defense towers.

  Of course, one could simply read the documentation for flexbox rules, but I feel like this game is a really good way to learn, since it's fun and you get practice!

  It covers =justify-content=, =align-items=, =flex-direction=, =order=, and =align-self=.

* Flexbox Froggy

  A bit of reading and I found out that this was based on Flexbox Froggy, which it quite good too. It has slightly less flashy graphics, but it has more levels and covers more properties: =flex-wrap=, =flex-flow=, and =align-content= (in addition to the ones Flexbox Defense overs).

  I hope there are more games to learn CSS with.

  I realize this is a short post but I wanted to share this finding. I also wanted to test out uploading images through org-page. And I need to do something about Disqus not working...

  UPDATE: (2016-03-09) I got the images working! Also realized I forgot to add links so I'm going to do that now.
